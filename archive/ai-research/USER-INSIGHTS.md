- **Mood Patterns**: Consistently low mood ‚Üí motivational persona
- **User Requests**: Direct requests for specific types of support

### **üéØ CRITICAL: AI Persona Proactive Behavior Philosophy**

**Core Vision**: AI personas should behave like **caring friends commenting on social media posts** - providing thoughtful, natural responses that add real value and create genuine engagement.

### **Expected Behavior Pattern**
1. **Immediate Response**: When user creates a journal entry, one AI persona responds automatically
2. **Proactive Follow-ups**: 5 minutes to 12 hours later, additional personas comment based on patterns and user engagement
3. **Collaborative Team Approach**: Multiple personas work together, complementing each other's insights
4. **Pattern Recognition**: AI identifies recurring themes and provides useful information/tips
5. **Social Media Feel**: Multiple caring friends naturally checking in over time

### **Sophisticated Timing Logic**
- **Initial comments**: 5 minutes to 1 hour after journal entry (vs previous 2-12 hours)
- **User engagement-based timing**: Immediate responses (1-2 mins) for actively engaging users
- **Bombardment prevention**: 30 minutes minimum between any responses
- **Daily limits**: 2-10 responses based on free/premium + AI interaction settings
- **Active user detection**: Only users with journal entries OR AI interactions in last 7 days

### **Collaborative Personas (No Expertise Areas)**
**Personas work as a team, not specialists:**
- **Pulse**: Emotionally intelligent wellness companion
- **Sage**: Big-picture thinking and strategic insights  
- **Spark**: Motivational energy and positive reinforcement
- **Anchor**: Grounding presence and practical support

**Key Principle**: Any persona can comment on any topic, but with their unique personality and perspective. They work together like a team of friends providing different viewpoints.

### **Commenting Style Examples**

**Good Examples** (like caring friends on social media):
- "Hey, I've noticed you've been dealing with work stress this week. Have you tried taking short breaks between tasks? Sometimes just 5 minutes of deep breathing helps me reset."
- "That's a really thoughtful reflection on your relationship. It sounds like you're growing and learning from this experience."
- "I love how you're being honest about feeling overwhelmed. That takes courage. What's one small thing you could do today to give yourself a break?"
- "You've been journaling consistently this week - that's amazing! I can see how much you're growing through this practice."

**Bad Examples** (avoid these):
- ‚ùå "I notice you mentioned work stress" (too robotic)
- ‚ùå "Based on your entry, you should..." (too clinical)
- ‚ùå "Here are 5 tips for stress management..." (too generic)
- ‚ùå "Your stress level is 8/10, consider..." (too analytical)

### **Quality Standards for AI Development**
- **Natural**: Feel like a caring friend, not a clinical bot
- **Specific**: Reference actual content from user's entries
- **Helpful**: Provide actionable insights, not generic responses
- **Timely**: Respond when the insight would be most valuable
- **Pattern-aware**: Recognize recurring themes across entries
- **Collaborative**: Build on other personas' responses when appropriate

### **User Engagement Tracking**
