# PulseCheck Optimized Structure
*For Continue.dev Cost Optimization*

This directory contains the reorganized PulseCheck project structure optimized for AI-assisted development with Continue.dev.

## 📁 **Project Structure Overview**

```

```

## 🚨 **Archive Access Protocol**

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: The `archive/` folder contains historical reference material and should only be accessed when:
1. **Explicitly stuck** and cannot find information in main codebase
2. **Historical context needed** for current problem
3. **User has approved** archive access
4. **Archive README has been read** first

**🔒 AI SAFETY**: Never access archive without user permission. See `archive/README.md` for detailed guidelines.

## 💰 **Cost Optimization Results**

### **Before Reorganization:**
- **Total Tokens:** 791,850 tokens
- **Estimated Cost:** $14.25 per full analysis
- **Context Limit:** Exceeded all model limits

### **After Reorganization:**
- **Total Tokens:** 476,525 tokens (40% reduction)
- **Estimated Cost:** $8.58 per full analysis (40% savings)
- **Individual Directory Costs:**
  - `core_ai`: $2.50
  - `ui`: $2.75
  - `backend_core`: $2.20
  - `docs`: $1.03
  - `configs`: $0.10

## 🚀 **Usage Guidelines**

### **For AI Development:**
- Load `core_ai/` directory for AI-related tasks
- Focus on specific services or routers as needed
- Avoid loading entire directory unless necessary

### **For UI Development:**
- Load `ui/` directory for frontend work
- Separate React and React Native components
- Load specific platforms as needed

### **For Backend Development:**
- Load `backend_core/` for server-side work
- Focus on specific modules (core, routers, services)
- Use main.py for application entry point

### **For Documentation:**
- Load `docs/` for documentation work
- Access specific documentation types as needed
- Use chunked files for large documents

### **For Configuration:**
- Load `configs/` for build and deployment work
- Access specific configuration files as needed
- Minimal token impact for config changes

## 📊 **Directory Breakdown**

| Directory | Tokens | Cost | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|------|---------|
| `core_ai/` | 138,939 | $2.50 | AI services and routers |
| `ui/` | 152,786 | $2.75 | User interface components |
| `backend_core/` | 122,076 | $2.20 | Backend services and utilities |
| `docs/` | 57,205 | $1.03 | Documentation and guides |
| `configs/` | 5,519 | $0.10 | Configuration files |

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

1. **Load only what you need** - Don't load entire directories unnecessarily
2. **Use focused queries** - Ask specific questions about specific files
3. **Monitor token usage** - Keep track of costs during development
4. **Reuse context** - Don't reload information already available
5. **Archive with caution** - Only access archive when explicitly needed

## 🔒 **AI Safety Measures**

- **Maximum token usage:** 50,000 tokens per session unless approved
- **Cost threshold:** $5.00 maximum per session unless user approves higher
- **Archive access:** NEVER without explicit user permission
- **Large file loading:** Confirm with user before loading files >10,000 tokens

**Ready for efficient AI-assisted development!** 🚀
