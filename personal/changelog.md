### Decisions Made
- **Tech Stack**: React Native + Node.js/Express + PostgreSQL + OpenAI GPT-4
- **Target User**: Tech workers (developers, PMs, designers) at burnout risk
- **Core Value Proposition**: "Therapy in disguise" - 2-3 minute daily AI-powered wellness check-ins
- **Privacy Strategy**: Local-first storage with end-to-end encryption
- **Development Approach**: MVP in 4-6 weeks, MMP in 10-12 weeks
- **AI Strategy**: OpenAI GPT-4 with custom prompt engineering for therapist-style responses

### Architecture Highlights
- **Data Flow**: User Input → Local Processing → Encrypted Transmission → AI Analysis → Personalized Response
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption, HIPAA-aware design, GDPR compliance
- **Scalability**: AWS/Vercel infrastructure, PostgreSQL + Vector DB for AI embeddings
- **Mobile-First**: React Native for iOS/Android with offline capability

### Success Metrics Defined
- **Primary**: User-reported wellbeing improvement, 70%+ daily check-in rate
- **Secondary**: 60%+ 30-day retention, <3 second AI response time
- **Business**: Net Promoter Score >50, low support ticket volume

### Risk Assessment
- **Technical**: AI response quality, mobile performance, data security
- **Product**: User trust with emotional data, clinical boundary management
- **Business**: App store approval, regulatory compliance, competitive differentiation

## Decision Log

### Technical Decisions

**Database Choice: PostgreSQL + Vector DB**
- *Rationale*: Structured data for user profiles, time-series for mood data, vector storage for AI embeddings
- *Alternatives Considered*: MongoDB, Firebase, SQLite
- *Trade-offs*: Complexity vs. scalability and AI integration needs

**AI Provider: OpenAI GPT-4**
- *Rationale*: Best-in-class language understanding, established API, clinical-appropriate responses
- *Alternatives Considered*: Anthropic Claude, local models, custom training
- *Trade-offs*: Cost vs. quality, dependency vs. control

**Mobile Framework: React Native**
- *Rationale*: Cross-platform development, large community, suitable for data-heavy apps
- *Alternatives Considered*: Flutter, native iOS/Android, PWA
- *Trade-offs*: Performance vs. development speed

### Product Decisions

**Target Market: Tech Workers**
- *Rationale*: Specific pain point, high burnout rates, data-driven mindset, willing to pay for solutions
- *Alternatives Considered*: General wellness market, healthcare professionals, students
- *Trade-offs*: Market size vs. product-market fit specificity

**Positioning: Wellness Tool (Not Medical)**
- *Rationale*: Regulatory simplicity, app store approval, user comfort
- *Alternatives Considered*: Digital therapeutics, clinical tool, medical device
- *Trade-offs*: Impact claims vs. regulatory burden

**Monetization: Freemium + B2B**
- *Rationale*: Aligns with user wellbeing, scalable, addresses enterprise wellness market
- *Alternatives Considered*: Subscription-only, ad-supported, data monetization
- *Trade-offs*: Revenue potential vs. user trust

## Lessons Learned

### Project Setup Phase
- **Documentation First**: Comprehensive upfront documentation prevents scope creep and alignment issues
- **Dual-Role System**: Combining technical execution with PM mentoring creates more realistic project complexity
- **Privacy by Design**: Addressing data protection from initial architecture is crucial for wellness apps
- **User Problem Focus**: Every feature decision must trace back to specific user pain points

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **AI Quality**: Extensive prompt engineering and testing before user-facing deployment
- **User Trust**: Transparent privacy practices and gradual feature introduction
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Early consultation with legal experts on mental health app requirements
- **Technical Debt**: Prioritize clean architecture over rapid prototyping for sensitive data handling
