# Personal Notes - PulseCheck Development

*Working thoughts, experiments, and ideas*

---

## üí≠ Current Focus Areas

### AI Prompt Engineering Ideas
- Test different therapist communication styles (CBT, humanistic, solution-focused)
- Experiment with response length - concise vs detailed insights
- Crisis language detection patterns to research
- Personalization techniques - referencing user's specific language/themes

### User Experience Hypotheses
- **Check-in Timing**: Morning check-ins might be more optimistic, evening more reflective
- **Entry Method**: Voice-to-text could increase engagement for busy users
- **Progress Visibility**: Visual progress tracking might motivate consistency
- **Micro-Interventions**: 15-minute suggestions might be more actionable than longer ones

### Technical Experiments to Try
- Local sentiment analysis vs OpenAI for real-time mood classification
- Progressive loading of AI insights while user continues their day
- Offline capability for core check-in functionality
- Data compression techniques for efficient mobile storage

## üéØ Product Questions to Explore

### User Research Needed
1. How do tech workers currently track their mental state? (if at all)
2. What time of day would they prefer to do wellness check-ins?
3. What level of detail in AI insights feels helpful vs overwhelming?
4. Would users trust AI-generated insights enough to act on them?
5. What would make someone abandon a wellness app after initial try?

### Competitive Analysis Deep-Dive
- **Daylio**: Great data tracking, but insights are basic charts - no AI personalization
- **Sanvello**: Good mood tracking, some AI, but generic wellness not tech-focused
- **Headspace for Work**: Corporate wellness but generic meditation, not burnout-specific
- **BetterHelp**: Professional therapy but expensive and time-intensive

### Market Positioning Questions
- How do we position against "just talking to ChatGPT about your problems"?
- What's our defensibility if other apps add similar AI features?
- Should we emphasize the tech worker focus or broader appeal?
- How do we handle the inevitable "this isn't real therapy" criticism?

## üß™ Ideas to Test

### MVP Feature Experiments
- **Emoji + Scale Mood Entry**: Test if dual input gives better data than single method
- **AI Response Timing**: Immediate vs delayed delivery (like getting insights next morning)
- **Pattern Recognition Threshold**: How many days of data before showing trends?
- **Micro-Intervention Types**: Focus on work breaks vs exercise vs mindfulness vs social

### Advanced Feature Ideas (Post-MVP)
- **Team Burnout Dashboard**: Anonymous company-wide wellness trends for managers
- **Peer Support Matching**: Connect users with similar stress patterns
- **Integration with Work Tools**: Slack status updates, calendar block suggestions
- **Predictive Burnout Alerts**: Early warning system based on pattern changes

### Monetization Experiments
- **Freemium Threshold**: What features should be premium vs free?
- **B2B Pilot Structure**: How to price employee wellness packages?
- **Professional Referrals**: Revenue share with therapists/coaches?
- **Data Insights**: Anonymous aggregate insights for workplace wellness research

## üö® Concerns & Risks

### Technical Risks
- **AI Consistency**: GPT responses can vary - need robust prompt engineering
- **Mobile Performance**: Large data sets and AI processing on mobile devices
- **Privacy Compliance**: GDPR/HIPAA requirements complex for emotional data
- **API Dependency**: Heavy reliance on OpenAI - need fallback strategies

### Product Risks  
- **User Trust**: Sharing emotional data requires high trust - one misstep could kill adoption
- **Clinical Boundaries**: Walking the line between helpful and overstepping into medical advice
- **Habit Formation**: Most wellness apps have low retention - need strong habit loops
- **Tech Worker Skepticism**: Our target users might be especially critical of AI solutions

### Business Risks
- **Market Saturation**: Wellness apps are crowded - differentiation critical
- **Regulatory Changes**: Mental health app regulations could evolve quickly
- **Scaling Economics**: OpenAI costs could make unit economics challenging at scale
- **App Store Approval**: Mental health apps face extra scrutiny
