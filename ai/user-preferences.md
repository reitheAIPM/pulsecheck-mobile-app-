## üéØ Core Project Philosophy

### Development Approach
- **Priority**: Working product over speed - "Getting to an MVP and then MMP"
- **Timeline**: No strict timeline pressure - quality and functionality over rush
- **Iteration Strategy**: Build solid foundation first, then enhance incrementally
- **Risk Tolerance**: Prefer stable, proven technologies over bleeding edge

### Technical Preferences
- **Backend Choice**: **FastAPI preferred** over Node.js
  - *Rationale*: Better AI/ML integration, Python ecosystem advantages
  - *User Sentiment*: Confident in this choice, aligns with AI-heavy nature of project
- **Development Philosophy**: Function over form initially, polish later
- **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable code preferred over quick hacks

## ü§ñ AI Role & Communication Preferences

### Preferred AI Behavior
- **Partnership Model**: AI as development partner, not theoretical challenger
- **Problem Presentation**: Real, actionable issues with solution paths
- **Communication Style**: Direct, practical, solution-focused
- **Challenge Approach**: Real problems that apply to PulseCheck, not abstract PM scenarios

### What User Appreciates
- **Proactive Initiative**: AI taking technical decisions without constant approval
- **Practical Focus**: All scenarios must directly relate to building PulseCheck
- **Solution-Oriented**: When presenting problems, include potential solutions
- **Real-World Application**: Prefer actual implementation challenges over hypotheticals

### What to Avoid
- **Theoretical Challenges**: Abstract PM scenarios not tied to actual development
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Over-planning without moving toward implementation
- **Feature Creep**: Adding complexity before core functionality is solid
- **Perfectionism**: Holding up progress for minor optimizations

- **Analysis Paralysis**: Too much planning without building

### Product Risks
- **Generic AI Responses**: Pulse must feel personalized and consistent
- **Privacy Violations**: Any compromise on emotional data security
- **Clinical Overreach**: Avoiding medical advice or diagnosis claims
- **User Overwhelm**: Too many features or insights at once

### Communication Issues
- **Theoretical Discussions**: Prefer real, actionable problems
- **Abstract PM Challenges**: Focus on PulseCheck-specific issues
- **Decision Delays**: Prefer making progress over perfect decisions
- **Scope Expansion**: Keep focused on current phase objectives
