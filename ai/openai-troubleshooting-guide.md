# OpenAI API Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Quota Exceeded**

**Diagnostic Results**: 
- ❌ **Error Code**: 429 - `insufficient_quota`
- ❌ **Error Message**: "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details"
- ✅ **API Key**: Valid and properly configured
- ✅ **Models Available**: gpt-3.5-turbo is accessible
- ✅ **Fallback System**: Working perfectly (preventing crashes)

## 🔧 **SOLUTION STEPS**

### **Step 1: Check OpenAI Account Billing** ⭐ **MOST LIKELY FIX**

1. **Go to**: https://platform.openai.com/billing
2. **Check your credit balance**:
   - Look for **"Credit balance"** or **"Available balance"**
   - If balance is **$0.00 or negative**, this is the issue!

3. **Common scenarios**:
   - **New accounts**: May have $0 balance after free trial expires
   - **Existing accounts**: May have small negative balance (even -$0.70 can block access)
   - **Auto-recharge disabled**: Balance reached $0 and didn't auto-refill

### **Step 2: Add Credits to Your Account**

**Option A: One-time Payment**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/billing
2. Click **"Add payment method"** if none exists
3. Click **"Add credits"** 
4. **Recommended**: Add $5-10 for MVP testing (will last months!)

**Option B: Auto-recharge (Recommended)**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/billing  
2. Enable **"Automatic recharge"**
3. Set **"Auto-recharge amount"**: $5-10
4. Set **"Trigger threshold"**: $1-2

### **Step 3: Check Project Limits** ⭐ **SECOND MOST LIKELY**

1. **Go to**: https://platform.openai.com/organization
2. **Select your organization** (top-left dropdown)
3. **Select your project** (where your API key was created)
4. **Click "Project limits"** (left sidebar)
5. **Check "Allowed models"**:
   - Ensure **gpt-3.5-turbo is NOT blocked**
   - If models are blocked, click **"Edit"** → **"Block"** → **Unselect all models**

## 💰 **Cost Expectations After Fix**

Once resolved, your costs will be **extremely low**:

- **Per interaction**: ~$0.0005 (1/20th of a penny)
- **Daily testing (10 interactions)**: ~$0.005 
- **Monthly MVP testing**: **$1-3 maximum**
- **$5 credit**: Will last 2-3 months of active testing
- **$10 credit**: Will last 6+ months

## 🧪 **Testing After Fix**

Run this command to verify the fix:
```bash
cd backend
python test_openai_direct.py
```

**Expected results after fix**:
- ✅ Direct API call successful
- ✅ Real AI responses (not fallbacks)
- ✅ Confidence scores >0.7
- ✅ Personalized responses for tech workers

## 🛡️ **Prevention Strategies**

### **Set Up Cost Monitoring**
1. **Usage limits**: Set monthly spending limit ($10-20)
2. **Email alerts**: Get notified at 75% of limit
3. **Auto-recharge**: Prevent service interruption

### **Cost Optimization Already Implemented**
- ✅ **Token limits**: Reduced from 500 to 250 tokens
- ✅ **Smart fallbacks**: Prevent costly errors
- ✅ **Efficient prompts**: 30-50% token savings
- ✅ **Local calculations**: No AI cost for basic insights
