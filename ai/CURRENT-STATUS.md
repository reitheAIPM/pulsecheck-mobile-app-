### **Request-First Debugging Protocol Implementation:**
Following user's specification for debugging workflow:
1. **Always trigger API requests first** using curl/fetch to generate activity
2. **Then capture logs** while activity is happening for maximum visibility
3. **Use structured debug endpoints** instead of manual investigation
4. **Target 80% reduction** in debugging tool calls through AI-ready data

### **Enhanced Logging Features:**
- **Immediate Console Output**: All endpoints log with emoji indicators
- **Forced Stdout Flushing**: Ensures logs appear immediately in Railway
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error categorization and analysis
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance grading and recommendations
