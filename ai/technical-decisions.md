- Node.js/Express: JavaScript consistency with frontend
- Django: More batteries-included but heavier for API-only service
- Flask: Lighter but requires more manual configuration

**Implications**:
- Need Python development environment
- Different language from React Native frontend
- Better AI integration capabilities
- Automatic API docs for testing

**Status**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

**Decision**: React Native with Expo for mobile development

**Rationale**:
- Cross-platform development (iOS + Android)
- Large community and ecosystem
- Good for data-heavy applications
- Expo simplifies deployment and testing
- Native performance for mobile-first experience

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Flutter: Good performance but Dart learning curve
- Native iOS/Android: Best performance but 2x development time
- PWA: Web-based but limited mobile capabilities

**Implications**:
- JavaScript/TypeScript development
- Need Expo development environment
- Easy testing on multiple devices
- App store deployment process

**Status**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

- Built-in authentication and row-level security
- Real-time subscriptions for data sync
- Good developer experience and documentation
- Scales well for MVP ‚Üí MMP growth

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Firebase: Google ecosystem but vendor lock-in concerns
- AWS Cognito + RDS: More control but more complexity
- Custom auth: Too much work for MVP

**Implications**:
- PostgreSQL SQL knowledge needed
- Real-time capabilities out of the box
- Easy user management and security
- Good integration with FastAPI

**Status**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

### Deployment: Railway
**Date**: Project initialization  
**Decision**: Railway for backend deployment

**Rationale**:
- Simple deployment for Python applications
- Good FastAPI support and examples
- Automatic HTTPS and domain management
- Reasonable pricing for MVP scale
- Easy environment variable management

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Vercel: Better for frontend, less ideal for Python backend
- Heroku: More expensive, platform uncertainty
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk: More complex setup
- DigitalOcean App Platform: Good option but less FastAPI-focused

**Implications**:
- Simple deployment pipeline
- Integrated database hosting option
- Automatic SSL certificate management
- Need Railway account and billing setup

**Status**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

### AI Provider: OpenAI GPT-4
**Date**: Project initialization  
**Decision**: OpenAI GPT-4 for Pulse AI personality

**Rationale**:
- Best-in-class language understanding and generation
- Consistent personality development capabilities
- Proven track record with emotional/therapeutic applications
- Excellent API and Python SDK
- Good cost-performance ratio for MVP scale

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Anthropic Claude: Good alternative but less established ecosystem
- Local models: Privacy benefits but complexity and performance issues
- Azure OpenAI: Enterprise features but more complex setup

**Implications**:
- External API dependency and costs
- Need API rate limiting and fallback strategies
- Excellent response quality for Pulse persona
- Requires careful prompt engineering

**Status**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED
