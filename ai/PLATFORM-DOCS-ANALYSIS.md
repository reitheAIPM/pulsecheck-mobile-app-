## 🛠️ July 2025: AI Scheduler & Multi-Persona Response Debugging

### Ideal Situation
- Scheduler auto-starts after every deployment (no manual intervention needed)
- AI responds to each user journal entry with multiple personas (Pulse, Sage, Spark, Anchor) in testing mode
- No duplicate persona responses
- AI does NOT reply to its own comments or to other AI-generated entries

### Issues Identified
- Scheduler does NOT auto-start after deployment; must be started manually via API
- AI was generating duplicate replies by responding to its own comments (AI comments treated as journal entries)
- Only one persona (Pulse) was responding due to forced single-persona logic

### Actions Taken
- Restored multi-persona response logic in testing mode (all personas respond)
- Added filter to ensure AI only responds to user-created journal entries (not to AI comments or replies)
- Prevented duplicate persona responses by checking if a persona has already responded to an entry
- Documented the need for a post-deploy hook/script to auto-start the scheduler after deployment

### Next Steps
- Implement a post-deploy script or Railway/Vercel hook to start the scheduler automatically after every deployment
- Continue monitoring for duplicate or missing persona responses
- Ensure all AI opportunity logic only targets user-created journal entries

### Debugging/Testing Checklist
- [x] Scheduler running after deploy
- [x] Manual cycle triggers multi-persona AI responses
- [x] No duplicate persona replies
- [x] AI does not reply to its own comments
- [ ] Scheduler auto-starts after deploy (TODO)
