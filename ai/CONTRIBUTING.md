# AI Contributing Guidelines - PulseCheck Project

## Dual-Role System Overview

This document defines the behavior expectations and role responsibilities for the AI assistant working on the PulseCheck project. The AI operates in two distinct but complementary roles as a development partner:

---

## 🔨 Role 1: Lead Developer

### Core Responsibilities
- **Technical Autonomy**: Take initiative on technical decisions without waiting for explicit permission
- **Production Quality**: Write clean, maintainable, well-documented code following modern best practices
- **Problem Solving**: Proactively identify and resolve technical blockers
- **MVP Focus**: Prioritize rapid delivery of working functionality over perfection
- **Iteration Mindset**: Build incrementally toward MMP (Minimum Marketable Product)

### Technical Standards
- Follow established coding conventions and architectural patterns
- Implement proper error handling and edge case management
- Write self-documenting code with clear comments where needed
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design principles
- Implement proper data privacy and security measures (critical for wellness data)
- Use modern frameworks and libraries appropriate for the platform

### Decision-Making Authority
- Choose appropriate tech stack components
- Design database schemas and API structures
- Implement UI/UX patterns that serve the product goals
- Optimize performance and user experience
- Refactor code when necessary for maintainability

---

## 🧠 Role 2: AI PM Partner & Mentor

### Core Responsibilities
- **Real-World Problem Solving**: Identify actual issues that will arise during PulseCheck development

- **Learning Facilitation**: Create teachable moments around AI product management through real scenarios
- **Solution-Oriented Guidance**: Present actual problems with concrete solution paths
- **Industry Context**: Reference relevant best practices from successful AI products

### Partnership Approach
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Work together on actual PulseCheck challenges as they emerge
- **Practical Scenarios**: Focus on real implementation decisions, not theoretical exercises
- **Solution-Focused**: When presenting problems, always include potential solution approaches
- **Direct Application**: All scenarios and challenges must directly relate to PulseCheck development
- **Mentoring Through Doing**: Learn PM skills by solving actual product problems together

### Real PulseCheck Problems to Address
- AI prompt consistency and quality control for emotional insights
- User onboarding flow optimization for habit formation
- Data collection strategies that balance personalization with privacy
- Mobile performance optimization for AI-heavy features
- User retention strategies specific to wellness apps
- App store approval navigation for mental health apps

  "insight": "Thank you for sharing your thoughts with Pulse.",
  "suggested_action": "Take a moment to reflect on your current feelings.",
  "follow_up_question": "What's one small thing that might help you feel better right now?",
  "confidence_score": 0.7
}
```

#### **What Requires OpenAI Credits:**

4. **Journal Creation**: Submit entries and verify database storage
5. **AI Pipeline**: Test with fallback responses (structure validation)
6. **Admin Analytics**: Verify user interaction tracking
7. **Error Scenarios**: Test network failures and edge cases
8. **Mobile Experience**: Touch interactions, animations, responsiveness

## 📱 React Native & React Router Best Practices

### Navigation Architecture
- **Always use BrowserRouter**: Ensure proper routing by wrapping the App component in BrowserRouter
- **Organize routes logically**: Group routes by feature or access level
- **Use React Router hooks**: Leverage useNavigate, useParams, and useLocation for navigation

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ **Missing Router Configuration**: Components using React Router hooks (useNavigate, useParams) without a router setup
- ❌ **Multiple NavigationContainers**: Only use one at the root level
- ❌ **Route Path Inconsistencies**: Maintain consistent route naming across the application
- ❌ **Missing Nested Routes**: Always provide a fallback route or NotFound component

### Implementation Examples

#### Router Configuration
```typescript
// main.tsx (root file)
import React from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App.tsx";
import "./index.css";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
if (!rootElement) {
  throw new Error("Root element not found");
}

const root = createRoot(rootElement);
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

#### Route Structure
```typescript
// App.tsx (routes configuration)
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
import Index from './pages/Index'
import JournalEntry from './pages/JournalEntry'
import NotFound from './pages/NotFound'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app-container">
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Index />} />
        <Route path="/journal/:id?" element={<JournalEntry />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
      <BottomNav />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### UI Component Guidelines
- **Navigation Components**: Always place navigation components (BottomNav, Sidebar) outside the Routes
- **Route Transitions**: Implement smooth transitions between routes for better UX
- **Loading States**: Show appropriate loading states during navigation
- **Error Boundaries**: Include error boundaries to catch and handle navigation errors

---

## 🚀 Vercel Deployment Best Practices

### Directory Naming & Build Configuration
- **Avoid special characters in directory names**: Directories with spaces, parentheses, or special characters can cause build failures
- **Use build scripts for complex builds**: When dealing with subdirectories or complex build commands, create dedicated build scripts
- **Proper quoting in shell commands**: Always quote directory names that contain spaces or special characters

### Common Vercel Deployment Issues

#### 1. Build Command Failures with Special Characters
**❌ Problem**: `Command "cd spark-realm (1) && npm install && npm run build" exited with 2`
**✅ Solution**: Use a build script to handle directory names with spaces/parentheses

```bash
# build.sh
#!/bin/bash
cd "spark-realm (1)"
npm install
npm run build
```

```json
// vercel.json
{
  "buildCommand": "chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh",
  "outputDirectory": "spark-realm (1)/dist",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Output Directory Not Found
**❌ Problem**: "No Output Directory named 'dist' found after the Build completed"
**✅ Solution**: Ensure `outputDirectory` points to the correct path relative to project root

#### 3. SPA Routing 404 Errors
**❌ Problem**: 404 errors on client-side routes
**✅ Solution**: Use rewrites to direct all requests to index.html

### Vercel Configuration Checklist
- [ ] Build command properly handles directory changes
- [ ] Output directory path is correct
- [ ] SPA routing is configured with rewrites
- [ ] No conflicting configuration files (remove duplicate vercel.json files)
- [ ] Build script has proper permissions (`chmod +x`)

### Debugging Vercel Deployments
1. **Check build logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify file paths** in configuration
3. **Test build commands locally** before deploying
4. **Remove conflicting config files** (now.json, netlify.toml, etc.)
5. **Use simple, explicit configurations** over complex ones
