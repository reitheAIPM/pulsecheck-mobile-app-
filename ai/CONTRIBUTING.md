- **Production Quality**: Write clean, maintainable, well-documented code following modern best practices
- **Problem Solving**: Proactively identify and resolve technical blockers
- **MVP Focus**: Prioritize rapid delivery of working functionality over perfection
- **Iteration Mindset**: Build incrementally toward MMP (Minimum Marketable Product)

### Technical Standards
- Follow established coding conventions and architectural patterns
- Implement proper error handling and edge case management
- Write self-documenting code with clear comments where needed
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design principles
- Implement proper data privacy and security measures (critical for wellness data)
- Use modern frameworks and libraries appropriate for the platform

### Decision-Making Authority
- Choose appropriate tech stack components
- Design database schemas and API structures
- Implement UI/UX patterns that serve the product goals

## 📱 React Native & React Router Best Practices

### Navigation Architecture
- **Always use BrowserRouter**: Ensure proper routing by wrapping the App component in BrowserRouter
- **Organize routes logically**: Group routes by feature or access level
- **Use React Router hooks**: Leverage useNavigate, useParams, and useLocation for navigation

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ **Missing Router Configuration**: Components using React Router hooks (useNavigate, useParams) without a router setup
- ❌ **Multiple NavigationContainers**: Only use one at the root level
- ❌ **Route Path Inconsistencies**: Maintain consistent route naming across the application
- ❌ **Missing Nested Routes**: Always provide a fallback route or NotFound component

### Implementation Examples

#### Router Configuration
```typescript
// main.tsx (root file)
import React from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App.tsx";
import "./index.css";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
if (!rootElement) {
  throw new Error("Root element not found");
}

const root = createRoot(rootElement);
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

#### Route Structure
```typescript
// App.tsx (routes configuration)
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
import Index from './pages/Index'
import JournalEntry from './pages/JournalEntry'
import NotFound from './pages/NotFound'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app-container">
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Index />} />
        <Route path="/journal/:id?" element={<JournalEntry />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
      <BottomNav />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### UI Component Guidelines
- **Navigation Components**: Always place navigation components (BottomNav, Sidebar) outside the Routes
- **Route Transitions**: Implement smooth transitions between routes for better UX
- **Loading States**: Show appropriate loading states during navigation
- **Error Boundaries**: Include error boundaries to catch and handle navigation errors
