# Contributing to PulseCheck - AI Documentation Guide

**Purpose**: Master directory and guidelines for AI-assisted development  
**Last Updated**: January 30, 2025  
**Status**: Consolidated and optimized for maximum AI efficiency

---

## üöÄ **QUICK START FOR AI ASSISTANTS**

### **Project Structure Overview**
The PulseCheck project has two frontends and one backend:
- **`spark-realm/`** - Web frontend (React + Vite) - **CURRENT PRODUCTION**
- **`PulseCheckMobile/`** - Mobile app (React Native + Expo) - **FUTURE DEVELOPMENT**  
- **`backend/`** - FastAPI backend (Railway) - **PRODUCTION READY**

### **Essential Reading Order**
For 90% of development tasks, read these 2 files first:
1. **[AI-MASTER-CONTEXT.md](AI-MASTER-CONTEXT.md)** - Complete project understanding and master context
2. **[CURRENT-STATUS.md](CURRENT-STATUS.md)** - Real-time status and priorities

Then add specific files based on task type:
- **Development**: + [DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md](DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md) + [TECHNICAL-REFERENCE.md](TECHNICAL-REFERENCE.md)
- **Operations**: + [OPERATIONS-GUIDE.md](OPERATIONS-GUIDE.md)
- **Planning**: + [OPTIMIZATION-PLANS.md](OPTIMIZATION-PLANS.md)

## üö® **CRITICAL: REALISTIC ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è ANTI-SUGARCOATING PRINCIPLES**
**AI assistants MUST follow these realistic assessment guidelines:**

#### **1. Distinguish Between "Working" vs "Tested"**
- ‚ùå **Don't say**: "Frontend is operational" 
- ‚úÖ **Say**: "Frontend deployment exists but hasn't been tested"
- ‚ùå **Don't say**: "System is fully functional"
- ‚úÖ **Say**: "Backend API responds, but user experience is untested"

#### **2. Separate Layers of Functionality**
- **API Layer**: Endpoints respond to direct calls
- **Frontend Layer**: Web application loads and displays correctly
- **Integration Layer**: Frontend successfully communicates with backend
- **User Experience Layer**: Complete user workflows function end-to-end

**NEVER assume higher layers work because lower layers work.**

#### **3. Use Precise Status Language**
- ‚úÖ **"Backend API Confirmed Working"** - Tested and verified
- ‚úÖ **"Frontend Deployment Exists"** - Deployed but not validated
- ‚úÖ **"Authentication Untested"** - No end-to-end validation
- ‚úÖ **"User Experience Unknown"** - Haven't tested actual user flows
- ‚úÖ **"Partial Resolution Achieved"** - Some progress made, work remains

#### **4. Avoid False Confidence Indicators**
- ‚ùå **"Ready for Production"** - Unless EVERY component is tested
- ‚ùå **"Fully Operational"** - Unless complete user flows are validated
- ‚ùå **"100% Resolved"** - Unless end-to-end testing confirms success
- ‚ùå **"Ready for Users"** - Unless actual user experience is tested

#### **5. Document Confidence Levels**
For each component, provide:
- **Tested Status**: What has actually been validated
- **Confidence Level**: Percentage based on actual testing
- **Risk Assessment**: What could still fail
- **Validation Required**: What needs to be tested next

### **üéØ REALISTIC ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK**

#### **Status Categories:**
- **‚úÖ Confirmed Working**: Tested and verified functional
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Deployed but Untested**: Exists but no validation
- **‚ùì Unknown Status**: No testing or validation performed
- **‚ùå Known Issues**: Confirmed problems requiring fixes
- **üîÑ In Progress**: Currently being worked on

#### **Confidence Scale:**
- **90-100%**: Comprehensive testing completed
- **70-89%**: Major components tested, minor gaps remain
- **50-69%**: Some testing done, significant gaps exist
- **30-49%**: Limited testing, major unknowns
- **10-29%**: Minimal validation, high uncertainty
- **0-9%**: No meaningful testing performed

#### **Risk Assessment:**
- **Low Risk**: Extensive testing, known stable patterns
- **Medium Risk**: Some testing, standard implementations
- **High Risk**: Limited testing, complex integrations
- **Critical Risk**: No testing, major unknowns

### **üìù DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS FOR REALISM**

#### **Required Sections in Status Updates:**
1. **What We Actually Know** - Only confirmed, tested facts
2. **What We Don't Know** - Untested assumptions and unknowns
3. **Known Issues** - Confirmed problems requiring fixes
4. **High Risk Areas** - Components likely to fail
5. **Next Validation Required** - Specific testing needed

#### **Forbidden Optimistic Language:**
- "Should work" ‚Üí "Requires testing"
- "Ready for" ‚Üí "Needs validation before"
- "Fully functional" ‚Üí "API layer working, user layer untested"
- "Resolved" ‚Üí "Partially resolved, validation required"
- "Operational" ‚Üí "Backend operational, frontend unknown"

### **üîß VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS**

#### **Before Claiming Component Success:**
1. **Direct Testing**: Component tested in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Component works with dependencies
3. **User Flow Testing**: End-to-end user workflows function
4. **Error Scenario Testing**: Graceful handling of failures
5. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Works across expected environments

#### **Documentation Updates Required:**
- Update confidence levels based on actual testing
- Document specific test results and validation methods
- Identify remaining gaps and required validation
- Provide realistic timeline estimates
- Include risk assessment for untested components

---

**This file consolidates: original-file1.md, original-file2.md**
```

### **AI Efficiency Guidelines**
1. **Front-load Critical Information**: Most important details in first 50 lines
2. **Use Consistent Headers**: Standard `##` and `###` hierarchy throughout
3. **Include Practical Examples**: Code snippets and concrete examples for every concept
4. **Cross-Reference Appropriately**: Link to related sections in other consolidated files
5. **Update Timestamps**: Always update "Last Updated" field when making changes
6. **Be Realistic**: Follow anti-sugarcoating principles in all documentation

### **Writing Style for AI**
- **Be Specific**: Use concrete examples rather than abstract descriptions
- **Be Concise**: Prioritize essential information
- **Be Structured**: Use consistent formatting and hierarchy
- **Be Current**: Always reflect the latest project state
- **Be Honest**: Distinguish between tested facts and untested assumptions

## ü§ñ **AI Development Workflow**

### **Recommended Workflow for AI Assistants**
1. **Start Context Gathering**: Read AI-MASTER-CONTEXT.md + CURRENT-STATUS.md
2. **Assess Task Type**: Determine if it's development, operations, planning, or debugging
3. **Read Relevant Files**: Add 1-2 specific files based on task type
4. **Execute Task**: Implement solution with full context
5. **Update Documentation**: Update relevant files with realistic assessments
6. **Validate Claims**: Ensure all statements are based on actual testing/verification

### **Efficiency Tips**
- **Parallel Reading**: Use parallel tool calls to read multiple files simultaneously
- **Focused Reading**: Only read sections relevant to current task
- **Smart Cross-Referencing**: Use file references to understand relationships
- **Context Persistence**: Remember information across sessions when possible
- **Realistic Assessment**: Always distinguish between tested and untested functionality
